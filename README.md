# MultiEventMiner

MultiEventMiner supports transformer-based cross-lingual news event detection at different levels of data granularity 
(i.e. sentence level and token level), involving different language-based learning strategies and a novel two-phase transfer 
learning strategy.

More details will be available with the paper "TTL: Transformer-based Two-phase Transfer Learning for Cross-lingual News 
Event Detection" which is under the review process currently.
